## Goal:
1. Being able to download archival ALMA data, examine images, and produce figures.
  * Installing [CASA software package](https://casa.nrao.edu/)
  * Trying [ALMA data archive](https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/aq/)
  * Using the [APLpy python package](https://aplpy.github.io/) to create PDF figures.
2. Knowing the principles of radio interferometry.
3. Knowing how to use the [Submillimeter Array](http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/)
  * Proposing (for some instruction see [my webpage](https://baobabyoo.github.io/pages/students_topics/UsingTelescope_SMA.html))
  * Calibrating data using either the [CASA software package](https://casa.nrao.edu/) or [MIR IDL software package](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~cqi/mircook.html) (requiring an access to [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language) license)

## Suggested Textbooks:
1. [Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II](https://www.aspbooks.org/a/volumes/table_of_contents/?book_id=292) (primary)
2. [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4) (advanced reference)
3. [Tools of Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-85122-6) (handy but buggy)
4. All qualitative introduction is given in [my webpage](https://baobabyoo.github.io/pages/students_topics/AstroBasic_RadioInterferometer.html)
