## Goal:
1. Being able to download archival ALMA data, examine images, and produce figures.
  * Installing [CASA software package](https://casa.nrao.edu/)
  * Trying [ALMA data archive](https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/aq/)
  * Using the [APLpy python package](https://aplpy.github.io/) to create PDF figures.
2. Knowing the principles of radio interferometry.
3. Knowing how to use the [Submillimeter Array](http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/)
  * Proposing (for some instruction see [my webpage](https://baobabyoo.github.io/pages/students_topics/UsingTelescope_SMA.html))
  * Calibrating data using either the [CASA software package](https://casa.nrao.edu/) or [MIR IDL software package](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~cqi/mircook.html) (requiring an access to [IDL](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/idl_programming.html))

## Expectation:
1. This is a 3-credits' course. The expected weekly workload for you is 2 hours on average if you have no experience and knowledge in this area.
2. There is no final exams. The workload for you to produce your final report may be 10~15 hours if you have no experience and knowledge in this area.

## Suggested Textbooks:
1. [Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II](https://www.aspbooks.org/a/volumes/table_of_contents/?book_id=292) (primary)
2. [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4) (advanced reference)
3. [Tools of Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-85122-6) (handy but buggy)
4. All qualitative introduction is given in [my webpage](https://baobabyoo.github.io/pages/students_topics/AstroBasic_RadioInterferometer.html)
